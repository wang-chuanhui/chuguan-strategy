??? question "How do I add a device or entity to an area?"

    You can add devices to an area by going to `Settings` found at the bottom of the sidebar.

    1. Select `Devices & services`.
    2. Select `Devices` or `Entities`at the top.
    3. Choose the device or entity you wish to add to an area.
    4. Select :material-pencil: or :material-cog: in the top right corner.
    5. Choose an area in the area field.

    !!!  warning
        If you created an entity manually (in your `configuration.yaml`), you may need to create a `unique_id` before 
        you can set an area to it.  
        See Home Assistant's [documentation][uniqueIdUrl] for more info about unique ids.

??? question "How do I hide entities from the Strategy?"

    When creating this dashboard for the first time, you might be overwhelmed by the number of entities.  
    To reduce the number of entities shown, you can hide these entities by following the steps below:
    
    1. Click and hold the entity.
    2. Click :material-cog: in the top right corner of the popup.
    3. Set `Visible` to `off`.
    
    
    !!! note
        If you don't want to hide the entity from all dashboards, you can use [Card Options][cardOptionsUrl] to hide
        specific entities and devices.
